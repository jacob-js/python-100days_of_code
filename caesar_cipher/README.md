## Caesar cipher

# What is a Caesar cipher?

_**Caesar cipher** is a type of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence._
